            <p class="disclaimer">IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER! This website is a student project dedicated primarily to humor the aspiring fellow student web-developers who are likely to spend the best hours of their future working days being predominately physically inactive, eating fast food and chronically missing sleep. The contents at hand don't necessarily reflect the author's viewpoints or values nor hold any clearly confirmed backing in scientific research. The author vaguely remembers an old Latin proverb: "Anima sana in corpore sano" but dares not translate it. Cheers!</p>
