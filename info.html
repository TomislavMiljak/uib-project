    <p>This is a Digital Career Institute (DCI) WD23-E08 UIB    Final project.
        It was crafted by an aspiring web-developer student Tomislav Miljak in Visual Studio Code software surrounding, using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading StyleSheets (CSS).
        As described in the HTML document, the scope of this mini website, along its main purpose to showcase a fair amount of author's applied knowledge and experience accumulated from the teachers, colleague students and his own during the period of attendance of the Basic Digital Literacy and User Interface Basics modules, is to target and humour other aspiring web-developer students and fellow colleagues, by offering a short but insightful overview and plenty of suggested reading material on the subject of healthy living.
        
        Some of the showcased procedures used to craft the mini website at hand include HTML structuring of the elements, and nesting them inside each other where appropriate per author's ideas, and linking outside photographies, published scientific and/or other articles from the internet, and further CSS styling the aforementioned HTML elements also in regards to the authors ideas and taste for aesthetics.
        
        As mentioned also in the disclaimer within the mini website, the scope of this mini-website is at the niveau of the above described.
